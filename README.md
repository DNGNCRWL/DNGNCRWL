- SOS Meeting (at anytime for coding assistance)

## Goals
1. Make a dungeon crawler in Unity
2. Learn group game development
3. Have fun

## Meeting and Communication Norms

### Availability for meeting expectations

The daily scrum meetings are designed to be 5-10 minutes in length, but may take longer initially as we settle into the project. Members are expected to be available for 25-30 minutes. Meetings will begin on Discord and move over to Microsoft Teams if there are any technical difficulties. Other meetings like the paired/collaborative can be achieved by in person meetings or remote video. All weekly coordination will be discussed as a group and voted on democratically at the daily scrum for both their utility and timing. A Member must provide a notification to the group if he/she anticipates missing any of the scheduled meetings. If a team member can't make the Thursday 5:30 time slot or Daily Scrums, that person needs to notify the team ASAP to attempt to restructure the meeting to a more suitable time.

### Response time to communication expectations

All communications are handled through Discord, which in turn is linked to personal emails. Each member is expected to respond within 2-4 hours to updates and messages. Members are expected to at minimum acknowledge to the group that they have read the messages.  In the event that a member fails to respond to a message, there will be two additional efforts to contact the person leading up to a 48-hour limit. If the person is MIA for more than 48 hours, the team  will have the TA attempt to contact member.

### Scrum meeting format/frequency and distribution of documentation tasks (meeting minutes, updating task board)

Daily Scrum meetings as mentioned are brief check-ins in which each member will be responsible for updating the team on three specific questions: What they have achieved since the last meeting? What they intend to achieve for the next meeting? What problems/technical difficulties are they encountering? To facilitate this task and speed up the meeting time, a form document with the three questions will be filled out by each team member prior to the meeting. This will be used to produce the daily log that will instruct how the teams proceeds with tasks and issues. Each team member is in charge of creating and updating their tasks. Updates to the Jira board are, however, open to all as tasks are identified as relevant to the sprint at hand.

### Procedure for handling a member who is not meeting expectations

The group is going to try to help out any member who might be struggling to meet expectations. Minor offenses (e.g. missing multiple meetings) or Major offenses (e.g. failing to produce completed tasks assigned, not following through on communication and collaborative sessions) will receive some the below mentioned disciplinary steps. However, the following protocol for handling a member and severity of the issue will be decided upon by the group. The general steps for dealing with a member who is not meeting expectations are the following:

- Step 1: The team as a whole will simply follow up with the member and let them know of the problem
- Step 2: The team will have a meeting to allow the member to describe the situation he or she is facing
- Step 3: The team will restructure the workload of the member by reducing their participation with the project
- Step 4: The team will notify the TA (???) and instructor (???) about the individual's failure and let them handle consequences



## Technical Work and New Policy Procedures

### General coding guidelines

- Follow SOLID principles and elegant class design
- Code in a way that others can easily understand and read
- Use comments for all methods; if any questions consult Comment documentation (Consult Comment Protocol in Info Discord)
- Comment (`""" """`, doc comments for pull requests, argument description, method description)

### Definition of done: When is a task complete?

In general, the concept of "done" follows logically from the PBI's and can be monitored and determined by how they fulfill the user stories. By tracking the development of the acceptance tests and their coverage of the PBI's, only then can a requirement be considered done. Specifically, a task is considered "done" when all changes have been committed and pushed to the remote repository branch, added code has proper documentation/comments, changes have been summarized in a pull request, 1-2 other team members have reviewed the code, any code issues have been addressed, and the team has approved changes and merged them with the main branch.

##### Check-in steps:

Prior to any push, the following check-in steps should be followed:

- Before check-in, confirm your code builds AND executes locally.
- Manually resolve any conflicts.
- Make sure your stuff builds and executes locally using the latest bits retrieved in the above step.
- Make sure unit tests are running correctly/new ones needed
- Code review from peer (minimum of 2 people approve code changes)
- Check-in with whole group

### Unit Test Guidelines

Our Unit Testing and test suite development will consist of three phases : 
  1. Phase 1 will be an initial development of unit tests and implementation of basic functionality to serve development. 
  2. Phase 2 will be a robust unit test suite production, breaking and reworking code implementation 
  3. Phase 3 will be a finalizing of unit tests and "massaging" of code to improve readability and consistency 

### Paired Programming

Our group embraces a certain amount of paired programming, which is intended to facilitate the coding and review process for tasks. Paired programming can be carried out in person or via video communication. It is up to the paired group to decide on how to meet task expectations and to fulfill the tasks (as described above) to meet PBI requirments.


### Procedure for adopting policies (e.g. code style, code check-in steps, documentation updates)

Policy modification can be addressed at any time. Members are free to address the group regarding any and all issues, changes, or additions he/she/it would like to make to the charter. The first step is to send out a policy suggestion through Discord. The team will decide whether the policy needs to be addressed at a SCRUM meeting or can democratically be approved on the spot through the chat. 

####Documentation updates: 
If a team member would like to make a update request to documentation, ideas can be brought up at any time during the group meeting to receive democratic approval other group members. New ideas developed during daily meetings will be noted in Trello and developed in this charter section.
